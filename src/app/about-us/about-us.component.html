              I live in Hong Kong and have closely witnessed the sudden dawn of COVID-19 disease (earlier known as novel Corona
              Virus) in this beautiful city.
              I also stand testimony to how Hongkongers have managed to keep infection rates low by practicing good hygiene and
              keeping themselves informed as this situation progresses.
              <br/><br/>
              The first case of COVID-19 in India was confirmed on 30 January 2020.
              Given the disease becoming increasingly threatening, I decided to develop this portal so that people can get the
              latest information on the situation in India.
              <br/><br/>
              Other than sharing the trait of indecipherable hand-writing with doctors, I am no medical expert myself.
              Information you see on this website is sourced strictly from Government and other verified agencies.
              <br/><br/>
              I released the initial version of this website with a weekend's worth of work. I have a regular day-job
              and manage to add new features to this website in the evenings (including this lengthy essay).
              Thankfully, I wouldn't have to sacrifice a lot many evenings as I am hopeful the situation will get better
              in the coming weeks as people become more aware and exercise precautions.
              Also, I am very optimistic about the medical community developing a vaccine or drug or both very soon.
              <br/><br/>
              This website is powered by open source technologies (see below) and numerous cups of Indian and Turkish tea.
              I do not intend to put any advertisements on this portal. Nor do I seek donations.
              <br/><br/>
